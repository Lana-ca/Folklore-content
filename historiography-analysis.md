# Historiography Analysis: Black Folklore and the Politics of Representation

## The Throughline: Power, Agency, and the Politics of Knowledge Production

Your sources reveal a century-long conversation about **who has the authority to define, collect, and interpret Black folklore, and to what political ends**. This is fundamentally a story about power, resistance, and the evolution of scholarly frameworks for understanding Black cultural production.

## Timeline and Intellectual Shifts

### **Era 1: 1890s-1900s - The Battle for Interpretive Authority**

**Why Written Then:**
- **Context**: Jim Crow solidifying, Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), need to "scientifically" justify segregation
- **Moody-Turner's Key Insight**: Folklore became "a linchpin in debates over Jim Crow segregation"

**William Wells Newell (1888, American Folklore Society founder):**
- **Why**: Sought to professionalize folklore studies, distance from "romantic nationalism"
- **Argument**: Diffusion theory (culture circulates) vs. evolutionary models
- **Problem**: Still used evolutionary stages (savage → barbarism → civilization)
- **Political Function**: His "scientific objectivity" actually supported assimilationist ideology - Black people could/would shed their "primitive" folklore and become "civilized"

**Anna Julia Cooper (1894, Hampton Folklore Society):**
- **Why Writing Then**: Direct response to white control of folklore collection
- **Argument**: Black folklore has "vital importance" - "The American Negro cannot produce an original utterance until he realizes the sanctity of his homely inheritance"
- **Revolutionary Stance**: Advocated for Black control of their own narrative, folklore as basis for distinctive African American literary tradition
- **In Conversation With**: Directly challenging Newell's framework - refusing objectification, asserting folklore as source of cultural power, not evidence of primitivity

**The Hampton Folklorists (1893-1900):**
- **Why Active Then**: Post-Reconstruction, navigating between white institutional control (Hampton Institute) and Black self-determination
- **Tension**: Had to work within Alice Bacon's "scientific" framework while resisting being objectified as "native informants"
- **Moody-Turner shows**: They "questioned the politics of assuming a 'scientific,' and often objectifying, approach to the study of their own traditions"

**Paul Laurence Dunbar & Charles Chesnutt (1890s-1900s):**
- **Why Writing Then**: Height of minstrelsy, Plantation Tradition literature dominating representations of Black life
- **Dunbar's Strategy**: Masking and dissimulation - "The Sport of the Gods" (1902) critiques idealized notions of Southern folk, introduces urban North as site of Black folklore
- **Chesnutt's Approach**: "The Conjure Woman" (1899) - uses conjure as formal strategy, not just content; "The Colonel's Dream" (1905) - turns ethnographic gaze on WHITE folklore and customs
- **In Conversation With**: Countering Harris's Uncle Remus, exposing that "folklore" discourse is racialized - white customs called "tradition," Black customs called "primitive survivals"

### **Era 2: 1920s-1940s - Cultural Nationalism and the Question of Origins**

**W.E.B. Du Bois (1903, "The Souls of Black Folk"):**
- **Why This Moment**: Post-Sam Hose lynching, losing faith in pure empiricism as solution to race problem
- **Lamothe's Analysis**: Du Bois combines "thought and feeling" - dialectical relationship between scientific empiricism and emotional/artistic expression
- **The Sorrow Songs**: Folklore as expressing what language cannot - universal human tragedy through particular Black experience
- **"Of the Coming of John"**: Cautionary tale about Black intellectuals' relationship to "the folk" - education creates distance, but folk have agency to reject leaders who don't serve them
- **In Conversation With**: Extending Cooper's vision while grappling with class tensions within Black community; influencing entire Harlem Renaissance turn to folklore

**Zora Neale Hurston (1930s, "Mules and Men"):**
- **Why Then**: Harlem Renaissance, but also trained by Franz Boas in scientific anthropology
- **Revolutionary Method**: As insider, she could access what outsiders couldn't - "The Negro offers a feather-bed resistance... we let the probe enter, but it never comes out"
- **Your Notes Highlight**: "No more masked man" - Black people telling their own stories, owning the narrative
- **Academic Lineage**: Boas aimed to dismantle scientific racism with anthropology - major shift in how folklore is studied
- **In Conversation With**: Actualizing what Cooper called for in 1894; showing what Hampton folklorists couldn't fully do under white institutional control

**Melville Herskovits (1941, "The Myth of the Negro Past"):**
- **Why 1941**: WWII context, fighting fascism abroad while Jim Crow persists at home
- **Central Argument**: The "myth" that "The Negro is thus a man without a past" is a "principal support of race prejudice"
- **Five Components of the Myth** he's dismantling:
  1. Negroes are "naturally" childlike and adjust easily to oppression
  2. Only "poorer stock" of Africa was enslaved
  3. Tribal diversity prevented cultural continuity
  4. African cultures were so "savage" that enslaved people gladly adopted European ways
  5. Therefore, "The Negro is thus a man without a past"
- **Why This Matters**: If Black people have no history/culture, they can't claim equal standing
- **Scholarly Approach**: Documents African survivals (Africanisms) in New World - religion, music, family structures
- **In Conversation With**: Directly refuting the evolutionary frameworks that Newell and others used; providing empirical evidence for cultural continuity that Cooper, Hampton folklorists, and Du Bois intuited

### **Era 3: 1945-1970s - Critique and Consciousness**

**J. Mason Brewer (1945):**
- **Context**: WWII just ended, Double V campaign (victory abroad and at home)
- **Contribution**: Documents three periods of Negro folklore development (Slave Period, Readjustment 1866-1917, Modern epoch 1917+)
- **Shows**: Folklore is not static "survivals" but living, evolving cultural practice responsive to migration, war, depression, "culture of the underworld"

**Frank Durham on DuBose Heyward (1961):**
- **Why Early 1960s**: Civil Rights Movement gaining momentum
- **Critique**: Heyward's "constant aim was to present the Negro as an exotic, a primitive — atavistic"
- **Shows**: Even sympathetic white writers couldn't escape primitivist frameworks
- **In Conversation With**: Demonstrating what Cooper, Chesnutt, and Hurston were fighting against - the exoticization even by supposed allies

**Roger Abrahams (1970, "The Negro Stereotype"):**
- **Why 1970**: Post-riots of 1960s, need to understand urban unrest
- **Key Insight**: Stereotypes function ambivalently - they dismiss Black protest as "typical" behavior
- **Problem**: "When the people are finally ready to rise up, their cries go unheard because this behavior is in line with the stereotypes white people already have of them"
- **Shows**: How folklore-based stereotypes (lazy, violent, hypersexual) were internalized AND inverted by Black communities - "bad man" tales
- **In Conversation With**: Explaining how the representational strategies that Dunbar and Chesnutt fought continue to have material consequences

### **Era 4: 1990s-2010s - Agency, Resistance, and Hidden Transcripts**

**Robin D.G. Kelley (1993, "We Are Not What We Seem"):**
- **Why Early 1990s**: Post-civil rights era, rise of social history "from below"
- **Revolutionary Framework**: James C. Scott's "hidden transcripts" and "infrapolitics"
- **Central Argument**: Black working people's culture (jokes, songs, folklore, theft, foot-dragging, even conjure and divine intervention) constitutes political resistance
- **Key Quote**: "Much of southern black working-class culture falls outside 'conventional' labor history"
- **Methodological Insight**: "Folklorists, anthropologists, oral historians, musicians, and writers fascinated by 'Negro life' preserved cultural texts that allow scholars access to the hidden transcript"
- **In Conversation With**:
  - Validating what Hampton folklorists documented as everyday resistance
  - Showing "the folk" as active political agents, not passive objects
  - Arguing against Du Bois's concern in "Coming of John" - the folk DO have political consciousness without formal education

**Daphne Lamothe (2008):**
- **Why 2000s**: Part of "ethnographic turn" in literary studies
- **Contribution**: Shows Du Bois as proto-ethnographer, grappling with insider/outsider tensions
- **Key Framework**: Du Bois's "dialectical" approach - empiricism AND emotion, sociology AND art
- **The Veil as Ethnographic Metaphor**: "Stepping within the Veil" = participant-observer position
- **In Conversation With**: Rehabilitating Du Bois's complexity against simplistic readings; showing sophistication of early Black intellectuals' methodological self-awareness

**Eric Lott (2011, "Back Door Man"):**
- **Why 2011**: Sophisticated musicology meets cultural studies
- **Argument**: Urban blues as "percussive field" - "beating" encompasses police violence, factory labor, everyday violence, musical drumming
- **Quote**: "Langston Hughes famously quipped that bebop or bop music got its name from the 'bop!' of the policeman's nightstick on black heads"
- **Shows**: Folklore/music encodes political violence and resistance in sound itself
- **In Conversation With**: Demonstrating what Du Bois argued about sorrow songs - music expresses what language cannot; extends to show how Jim Crow violence is embedded in cultural forms

## The Conversation: Key Themes Across Time

### **1. The Question of Authority and Representation**

**1890s**: Who gets to define what Black folklore means?
- Newell: White "scientists"
- Cooper: Black people themselves
- Hampton folklorists: Negotiating white institutional control

**1930s-40s**:
- Hurston: Insider access yields different knowledge
- Herskovits: White scholar as ally, using empiricism to fight racism

**1990s-2010s**:
- Kelley: Recovering Black agency in the archive
- Scholars of color reclaiming historiographical authority

### **2. Folklore as Political Weapon (Both Directions)**

**Used AGAINST Black People:**
- Minstrelsy (Jim Crow character → Jim Crow laws)
- "Folkways" rhetoric: "Stateways cannot change folkways" (Sumner)
- Plessy v. Ferguson: Segregation follows "established customs"
- Stereotypes that dismiss resistance (Abrahams)

**Used BY Black People:**
- Hidden transcripts (Kelley)
- Cultural nationalism (Cooper, Du Bois, Harlem Renaissance)
- Literary resistance (Dunbar, Chesnutt)
- Asserting humanity and history (Herskovits)

### **3. Evolution of Scholarly Frameworks**

**1890s - Evolutionary/Diffusionist:**
- Savage → Barbarism → Civilization stages
- "Survivals" from primitive past
- Assimilation as progress

**1920s-30s - Cultural Relativism (Boas):**
- Cultures as distinct, equally valid
- Folklore as cultural expression, not evolutionary stage
- But: still often removed from political context

**1940s - Historical Particularism:**
- Herskovits: Document specific African retentions
- Attention to actual historical processes (Middle Passage, slavery)

**1970s-90s - Political/Agency Focus:**
- Abrahams: Folklore's role in power relations
- Kelley: "Infrapolitics" and hidden resistance

**2000s-2010s - Interdisciplinary Sophistication:**
- Lamothe: Ethnographic turn in literary studies
- Lott: Sound studies, embodiment, violence encoded in aesthetic forms

### **4. The Insider/Outsider Tension**

**Du Bois's Dilemma ("Of the Coming of John"):**
- Education creates distance from "the folk"
- "Double consciousness" - seeing self through others' eyes
- Can the educated Black intellectual represent the masses?

**Different Solutions:**
- Cooper: Reciprocal relationship between folk and literary traditions
- Hurston: Using insider status as methodological advantage
- Hampton folklorists: Working memory and personal experience, not distanced observation
- Kelley: Validating folk knowledge as political consciousness

### **5. What Counts as "Folklore"?**

**Expansion Over Time:**

**1890s**: Songs, tales, superstitions, customs
**1940s**: African retentions, religious practices, family structures
**1970s**: Stereotypes themselves as cultural texts
**1990s**: Everyday resistance practices (theft, foot-dragging), conjure as political strategy, even prayer and divine intervention
**2010s**: Sound, embodied violence, urban experience encoded in musical forms

## Why They Wrote When They Did: Historical Context

### **1890s-1900s: The Nadir**
- Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)
- Lynching epidemic
- Disenfranchisement (poll taxes, literacy tests)
- **WHY**: Battle over whether Black people would have any citizenship rights at all
- **Folklore's Role**: Used to justify segregation as "natural" (following "folkways")

### **1920s-30s: Harlem Renaissance & Great Migration**
- Urbanization of Black population
- Cultural flowering, "New Negro" identity
- **WHY**: Asserting modernity and cultural sophistication against "primitive" stereotypes
- **BUT**: Also mining Southern folk roots for authentic Black culture

### **1940s: WWII & Double V**
- Fighting fascism abroad, Jim Crow at home
- Contradiction between American democratic rhetoric and racist reality
- **WHY**: Herskovits writing to disprove ideological justifications for inequality
- **Anthropology as weapon**: Against Nazi racial ideology AND American racism

### **1960s-70s: Civil Rights & Black Power**
- Urban rebellions
- Black Studies programs emerging
- **WHY**: Need to explain Black political action and recover suppressed histories
- **Abrahams**: Understanding why white people didn't see protests coming

### **1990s: After Civil Rights Legislation**
- Reagan era backlash
- Rise of social history, cultural studies
- **WHY**: Kelley recovering working-class agency to counter narratives of Black passivity
- **"We Are Not What We Seem"**: Hidden resistance was always there

### **2000s-2010s: Post-Soul, Black Lives Matter Era**
- Continued police violence
- Questions of representation and authenticity
- **WHY**: Lott showing how Jim Crow violence is embedded in cultural forms
- **Sound studies**: Body as site of both beating and expression

## The Conversation's Arc

**Phase 1 (1890s-1900s)**: Battle for Control
- Can Black people represent themselves, or must they be represented?

**Phase 2 (1920s-40s)**: Asserting Cultural Value
- Black folklore as equal to European culture (Du Bois's sorrow songs)
- Documenting African heritage (Herskovits)

**Phase 3 (1960s-70s)**: Ideological Critique
- Exposing how folklore/stereotypes functioned politically
- "Culture of poverty" debates

**Phase 4 (1990s-2000s)**: Recovering Agency
- "The folk" as political actors, not victims
- Hidden transcripts and everyday resistance

**Phase 5 (2010s)**: Embodied Knowledge
- Violence and resistance encoded in sound, body, performance
- Sophisticated interdisciplinary approaches

## For Your Paper: The Meta-Narrative

The historiography of Black folklore is itself a story of **power and knowledge production**:

1. **Who has authority** to interpret Black culture?
2. **What political ends** does that interpretation serve?
3. **How do the interpreted talk back** to their interpreters?

Each generation of scholars responds to:
- **The political moment** (Jim Crow, Civil Rights, etc.)
- **Previous scholarly frameworks** (evolution → diffusion → relativism → political economy)
- **Ongoing struggle** over Black humanity, citizenship, and self-determination

The throughline is this: **Folklore has always been political**. Whether used to justify segregation or assert cultural dignity, whether collected by white "scientists" or Black insiders, whether interpreted as primitive survivals or sophisticated resistance - folklore sits at the intersection of culture, power, and identity.

**Anna Julia Cooper in 1894 already understood what it would take a century to fully articulate**: Black people must control their own narrative, folklore is a source of power not shame, and the relationship between "high" and "folk" culture must be reciprocal, not hierarchical.

**Your paper can show**: The conversation isn't linear progress toward truth, but a spiral - returning to questions of agency, representation, and power, but with increasingly sophisticated analytical tools and from increasingly diverse positionalities. The fact that we're still asking "who speaks for Black folk?" means the question Cooper raised in 1894 remains unresolved.
